## Troubleshooting

**If the extension doesn't work in Brave:**
- Make sure Brave Shields are not blocking the extension
- Try disabling "Prevent sites from fingerprinting me" for gemini.google.com
- Check that JavaScript is enabled

**If the extension doesn't load:**
- Make sure you're using the correct manifest file for your browser
- For older browsers, try using `manifest-v2.json` instead of `manifest.json`
- Check the browser console for any error messages

**For browsers that don't support Manifest V3:**
- Rename `manifest-v2.json` to `manifest.json`
- This provides compatibility with older browser versions
