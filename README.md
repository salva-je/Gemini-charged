## Main Features

* **Navigation Sidebar**: Access an index of your entire conversation. Click on any item to jump directly to that message.
* **Full History Load**: With a single click, the extension can automatically scroll to the top of the conversation to load all messages, ensuring nothing is left out.
* **Instant Search and Filtering**: Use the search bar to filter the message list in real-time and find exactly what you're looking for.
* **Message Sorting**: Organize the conversation view to your preference:
    * By chronological order (ascending or descending).
    * Grouped by type (user messages and Gemini responses).
* **Custom Notes**: Was a Gemini response particularly useful? Add a note directly in the sidebar to remember why it was important.
* **Color Highlighting**: Mark key messages with a color code to identify them visually at a glance.
* **Collapsible Interface**: The sidebar can be easily hidden and shown to not interfere with your workspace.
