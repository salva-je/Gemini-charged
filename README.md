## Main Features

* **Navigation Sidebar**: Access an index of your entire conversation. Click on any item to jump directly to that message.
* **Full History Load**: With a single click, the extension can automatically scroll to the top of the conversation to load all messages, ensuring nothing is left out.
* **Instant Search and Filtering**: Use the search bar to filter the message list in real-time and find exactly what you're looking for.
* **Message Sorting**: Organize the conversation view to your preference:
    * By chronological order (ascending or descending).
    * Grouped by type (user messages and Gemini responses).
* **Custom Notes**: Was a Gemini response particularly useful? Add a note directly in the sidebar to remember why it was important.
* **Color Highlighting**: Mark key messages with a color code to identify them visually at a glance.
* **Collapsible Interface**: The sidebar can be easily hidden and shown to not interfere with your workspace.

### Troubleshooting

**If the extension doesn't work in Brave:**
- Make sure Brave Shields are not blocking the extension
- Try disabling "Prevent sites from fingerprinting me" for gemini.google.com
- Check that JavaScript is enabled

**If the extension doesn't load:**
- Make sure you're using the correct manifest file for your browser
- For older browsers, try using `manifest-v2.json` instead of `manifest.json`
- Check the browser console for any error messages

**For browsers that don't support Manifest V3:**
- Rename `manifest-v2.json` to `manifest.json`
- This provides compatibility with older browser versions

## Usage

1.  **Activate the sidebar**: Once on the Gemini website, the sidebar will appear collapsed on the left. Click the `‚Ä∫` button to expand it.
2.  **Load messages**: If the conversation is very long, press the `Load all messages` button to load the full history.
3.  **Navigate**: Click on any item in the list to scroll to that message in the main window.
4.  **Add notes or colors**: Hover over an item in the list and you will see the `üìù` (notes) and `üé®` (colors) icons. Click them to use their features.
